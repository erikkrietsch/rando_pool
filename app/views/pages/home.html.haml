  ## Rules

  Rando Calrissian, known throughout the galaxy for his habit of gambling
  randomly, has created a modified NFL survivor pool. What follows are the
  complete rules.

  ## Entry Fees

  The fee to enter the pool is $10 per player, payable via PayPal to
  jon.allured@gmail.com.

  ## Aliases

  One thing Rando prides himself on is taking care of the needs of his clients.
  He understands that his clientele are a certain type of person and that
  privacy is very important to them. For this reason, aliases have been
  selected for each participant so that when picks are announced, no one knows
  who has picked which team.

  ## The Jar Jar Penalty

  After your rookie season, you are subject to the Jar Jar Penalty. The last
  veteran player to PayPal their entry fee will get Jar Jar as their alias.
  Turn that money in!

  ## Picks

  Each week Rando will secretly pick an NFL team at random. You pick one as
  well. After that week's games have been played, each player's pick is scored
  and one of four things could happen:

  1. Your team wins and Rando's team loses: congrats, you've just earned some
     points (more on this in a bit) and you're through to the next week.
  2. Your team wins and so does Rando's team: no points, but you're still
     through to the next week.
  3. Your team loses and so does Rando's team: you get through to the next
     week, but you lose some points.
  4. Your team loses, but Rando's wins: tough luck, you're out of the pool.

  You have until midnight each Wednesday to email in your pick. Rando's choice
  is revealed every Thursday morning. If you do not send in a pick, then you
  automatically get the team that is playing Rando's pick.

  ## Points

  You start with zero points and then outcomes 1 and 3 above add or subtract
  from that amount. Points are based on the delta of the scores of your team
  and their opponent. Say the Bears beat the Packers by 14. If you took the
  Bears and get outcome 1, then you just picked up 14 points. If you took the
  Packers and get outcome 3, then you lose 14 points.

  ## Weekly Emails

  Thursday morning the picks email goes out where you can see which teams have
  been picked - this is the email where you find out Rando's pick.

  Tuesday morning the results email goes out that recaps the week and updates
  the standings with how each player did.

  ## Re-entry

  Once per season, a player that was knocked out may pay to re-enter the pool
  the following week. The fee for re-entry is based on the week they want to
  re-enter. Say a player is knocked out in the first week and wants to pay to
  re-enter week two. That player would have to pay $10 * 2 or $20. Say a player
  is knocked out in week 9 and wants to re-enter week 10, that player would
  have to pay $10 * 10 or $100.

  Re-entry is expensive, but allows players that get screwed early in the
  season to get back in. It also allows players doing well at the end of the
  season to keep going with a great score. In both cases, the pot grows and it
  just means more money for the winners.

  ## End of the Season

  Players are ranked by points and at the end of the season, the top three
  players get paid. Yes, you can have a negative amount of points.

  It's possible to be knocked out and still place in the rankings - getting
  knocked out just means you aren't able to score any further points.

  An end of season summary email goes out with the final standings and the
  winners are paid out.

  ## Payouts

  At the end of the season, the top three players are paid out in a 65-25-10
  split of the pot.
